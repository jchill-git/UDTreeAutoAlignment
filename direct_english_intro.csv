"In the name of God, the most gracious, the most merciful"
"May Allah's blessings be upon our master Muhammad, his family and companions, and peace be upon him"
"The Sheikh, the scholar, the jurist, the writer, the just judge, the ascetic, the pious, the pious, the revealer, the worshiper, Sidi Mahmud, met Kaat al-Karmani, the home of al-Tanbukti, originally the abode of al-Wakri, may God Almighty have mercy on him and benefit us from it."
Amen
"Praise be to God, the One with the kingdom, the kingdom, the glory, the might, the subjugation, the overpowering, the compassionate and the merciful, the King, the Judge, the Able, the Beneficent, who created the earth and the heavens, and taught Adam the names, and brought forth from his loins kings and shepherds."
"So He tested them with the emergence of news and news, and excused them against the Sunnah, the good messengers."
"Then the scholars bequeathed their knowledge and succeeded the caliphs in their affairs, so it is to them that the farid are sheltered, and through them the obstinate opponent is suppressed."
That is why He made them His shadows on the earth and adorned them not with the adornment of light in the basin
Whoever obeys them has been guided and won
And whoever deviates from them has lost and disappointed
"We praise Him for what He bestowed upon us in terms of blessings and bounties, as He made us among His noble servants and removed the evil of enemies from us with the supplications of the scholars, the commandments of the wise, and the strictures of the sultans and caliphs."
"It is incumbent upon us to give him thanks, praise, prostration and bowing, as he is the Most High Lord"
So whoever obeys him has been guided and grasped the most trustworthy handhold
And whoever disobeys him has seduced an epidemic of loss and seduced
And we bear witness that there is no god but Allah
"The testimony of one who emptied his heart and his desires for the likes of his master’s affairs, and we will count that testimony, God willing, until the day he met him, the day when neither wealth nor children will benefit except he who comes to God with a sound heart."
"And we bear witness that our master Muhammad is His noble servant, His merciful messenger, His pure, forbearing, and we love Him, the trustworthy, the possessor of serendipitous signs, brilliant miracles, and conclusive proofs."
"He was sent to consolidate Islam, to correct sleep, to break idols, and to clarify laws and rulings."
The saying
"This matter began as prophecy and mercy, then it will be succession and mercy in hadith"
And the saying
A group of my nation will remain on the truth until the Hour is established
And the saying
Stick to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Caliphs after him
"May the peace and blessings of God be upon him, his honorable family, his companions, Luyuth Al-Dhargham, and all his brothers and descendants."
"The rest of his brothers and descendants, Sadat Al-Alam, from to pure, their lineage, each honorable and gentle"
"From among them, every chaste writer is elected, and the core of their actions is followed"
Everyone who is pious is alive and is guided by the honor of their sayings
"Everyone who is frugal, repentant, and upright follows their path"
Each guide is a corporal and to the fire he will guide them with his lamp
Every individual is loving and to the height of their knowledge is transcendent
"All intended well, so reward them"
"The Lord is the best reward for us, and He rewarded them on the Day of Calling the most abundant reward"
"And He made us, with His generosity, among those who are guided and in their group among those who are engaged"
"And with their benevolence from those who follow, for the sake of the best of creation"
And the best of those who gave guidance and the most generous of those who trampled the soil
"And after, when mentioning the stories of the prophets, sultans, kings, and the chiefs of countries was the habit of wise men and notable scholars"
Adopting the Sunnah of the Qur’an and a reminder of what has changed from time
"And God has blessed us by showing us in our time this righteous imam, the just caliph, the victorious sultan, and the victorious ruler, Askia."
"Al-Hajj Muhammad bin Abi Bakr Al-Nurdi, originally, Al-Kukwi was a home and residence"
"So He raised guidance for us after the oppression of darkness, and removed guidance from us after cowardice and death"
"So, praise be to God, the countries opened up for him, east and west, and delegations flocked to him individually and collectively, so the kings submitted to him, hating and voluntarily."
From His blessings we became well and blissful after we were in hardship and distress
"God Almighty replaced that with His grace, as He said to the most generous successor, “With hardship, there is ease.”"
I wanted to collect from his good condition with the mention of something high
Hand and tongue and to God Almighty reliance
"And I called it the history of the fascist in the news of countries, armies, and the most prominent people"
He mentioned the facts of recurrence and the greatness of things
And disperse the lineages of slaves from the free
